	   India is one of the mega under developed country of the world with respect to population status and dynamics.The growing rate of population is a direct factor responsible for enhancement of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation.The huge population of India is responsible for mammoth generation of MSW with daily rate of generation is <b>400g per capita</b>. The constituents of MSW mainly comprise of compostable items <b>(51-53%)</b>, followed by recyclable <b>(17-18%)</b> and having a moisture content of <b>46.76 %</b>. The MSW generated contains <strong>C/N ratio approximately 32 with calorific value of about 1700-1800 Kcal/Kg</strong>.Only fraction<b> (10-12%) </b>of the total compostable waste was found to be used for composting. There are plenty of technologies available for generating energy and other useful substances from the MSW ecofriendly, but <strong> 60%-90% of MSW </strong>generated in cities and towns are directly disposed off on or into land in an unsatisfactory manner.
